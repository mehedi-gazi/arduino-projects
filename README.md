# Arduino Starter Kit Projects

This repository contains my implementations of the official projects from the **Arduino Starter Kit Projects Book**. It‚Äôs a hands-on journey through the fundamentals of electronics and programming using Arduino, following the curated progression of the kit.

## üìò Source Material

All projects are inspired by the [Arduino Starter Kit Projects Book](https://store.arduino.cc/products/arduino-starter-kit-multi-language) ‚Äî a beginner-friendly guide that walks you through electronics with 15 guided projects.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project List

Each folder contains:
- `.ino` file (Arduino code)
- Notes or circuit diagrams (if any)
- Summary of what I learned from the project

## üß∞ Tools & Components

- Arduino Uno
- Resistors, LEDs, Capacitors
- Potentiometers, Buttons
- Thermistor, Photoresistor, Servo Motor, DC Motor
- Transistors, Piezo Buzzer, LCD, and more...

## üöÄ How to Run

1. Open the `.ino` file for a project in the Arduino IDE.
2. Build the circuit using a breadboard and the Starter Kit components.
3. Upload the code to your Arduino board.
4. Enjoy the magic of physical computing!

## üß† Purpose

This repo documents my journey through the Arduino Starter Kit as I strengthen my understanding of:
- Electronics & sensors
- C/C++ programming for microcontrollers
- Input/output logic, serial communication, and circuit design

## üîÆ What‚Äôs Next

Once the Starter Kit is complete, I plan to:
- Expand into custom Arduino projects
- Build IoT and sensor networks
- Explore ESP32, Raspberry Pi, and embedded C more deeply

## üì© Contact

Feel free to fork this repo or reach out if you‚Äôre learning with the Starter Kit too ‚Äî I‚Äôm open to collaborating, sharing notes, or improving projects together!
